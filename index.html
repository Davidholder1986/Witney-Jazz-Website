                                <p> <a href='http://www.robterrytrio.com'>Rob</a> and his trio have taken Mr Gershwin's jazz AND classical compositions and re-arranged them for piano, double bass and drums - the result is extraordinary! Combining a familiar  jazz standards repertoire with western classical music in a way that truly works - Rob Terry's music features melody and gripping dynamics, beautifully played. Their performances simply 'drip' with virtuosity, yet this is no pompous 'conceptual' band playing self indulgent originals. Rob, Paul and Charlie are definitely out to entertain. There are self penned pieces, but these are imbued with a sense of familiarity that renders them truly engaging. A delight........</p>

                                <p>This man Henderson is truly a remarkable musician. One time ‘Royal’ trumpeter, he's created an enviable reputation for himself in the UK as a performer of the highest calibre, jazz educator and composer. It's easy to draw comparisons with the greats, but Stuart's can be pitched somewhere between the warm joyous tones of Chet Baker and the hard Bop of Lee Morgan. Stylistically you cannot pigeon hole Mr Henderson, for Witney Jazz he'll be playing a selection of delicious, well known standards with a distinctly funky edge. On hand to assist with creating that all important rhythm will be hard hitting guitarist Hugh Turner, powerhouse bassist Paul Jefferies and a drummer of distinction - Simon Price.</p>

There’ll be nods to the classical world, beautiful arrangements of well known carols, christmassy jazz standards and a smattering of originals from Ben and Rob for you to get your teeth into.  </p>

Welcome - sadly not - the iconic figure (Oscar) himself, but a very worthy emulator in the more svelte shape of celebrated London based pianist Tom Pilling with Paul Jefferies sitting in for the great Ray Brown and ace midlands based drummer Nick Millward working the Ed Thigpen kit. There will be shed loads of swing; there will be shockingly good ballads and these three maestros will play through two sets of truly inspiring tunes - pieces that Oscar's Trio became famous for.</p>

                                <p>Trying to squeeze in here even a snapshot of Tina’s career and the accolades that follow her performances is tough! She’s performed and often recorded with just about everyone on the British, US and Euro scenes who is anyone, but we can tell you that her voice is utterly captivating - as is her presence and charisma on stage. Pin-point accurate pitch, immaculate phrasing and a vocal sound that’s both rich and smooth but with a hint of huskiness. So expect some scintillating jazz from Tina and a rather tight rhythm section of Rob Terry (piano), Paul jefferies (bass) and Charlie Stratford (drums). </p>
